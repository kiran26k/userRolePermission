 # Functionalities chosen to implement:
CRUD operation on CSV
Rest mapping 
Output in Log files 


 # Functionalities are implemented and what are the main challenges that you took into account when performing the implementation 
 (business reasons, technical and infrastructure reasons, etc)
- Used Apache CSV for services to work on CSV with common approach  
- Used Spring boot due to its easy configuration and in build server for checking local changes 
- Maven project build to easily add and update jars


 # Functionalities that could be added in the future to the application in order to make it more attractive to potential clients
- Adding data to database using Spring Repo
- Adding authentication from accessing to doing operation in CSV
- Storing such CSV files to AWS EC cloud for easy storage
